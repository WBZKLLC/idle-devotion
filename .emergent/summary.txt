The user has pivoted from a large-scale engineering task (Live2D animation system migration) to a design-focused task. The new primary goal is to replace all hero portrait images in the application to align with a new, detailed art direction.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- **P0: Hero Portrait Overhaul**: A design-only task to replace all 22 hero portraits.
  - **Phase 1: Art Direction Definition (COMPLETED)**: User provided a comprehensive art style guide and a Design Authority Document defining the emotional, visual, and power archetypes for each of the 22 heroes.
  - **Phase 2: Asset Replacement (IN PROGRESS)**: The user is providing a 6-image ascension set for each hero. The agent's task is to:
    1.  Receive the images for a hero.
    2.  Archive all 6 images in a structured folder: .
    3.  Use the **3-star image** as the **only** default portrait by updating the  field for that hero in .
    4.  **Strict Constraint**: No modifications to code logic, schemas, Unity, or Live2D systems are permitted. This is a content/configuration change only.
- **PAUSED: Live2D/Unity Integration (Phase 6)**: The previous task of implementing a real-time bridge between Expo and Unity is on hold.
- **PAUSED: Re-enable RevenueCat (P1)**: Paused due to native dependency issues.
- **NOT STARTED: Backend Code Cleanup (P2)**: Legacy, duplicate code in  needs refactoring.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project has a backend file, , which contains a hardcoded list of 22 heroes. A new asset archiving system has been established at , with subdirectories for each hero to store their 6 ascension images. For the first 6 heroes, the  in  has been updated to point to their respective 3-star portrait URL, and their full 6-image sets are archived.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was in the middle of processing the ascension images for the 7th hero, **Kai the Tempest**. It had just received the 1-star image (Wind Initiate), created the archive directory for Kai at , stored the image and its metadata in , and was awaiting the 2-star image.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N/A
    - Which testing method agent to use? Manual verification. The agent should view  after updating a hero's 3-star image to confirm the  string has been correctly replaced. No functional testing is needed.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The primary focus is the ongoing asset replacement task.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Update All Hero Portraits (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: The agent has processed the 1-star image for **Kai the Tempest**. It should now wait for the user to provide the 2-star, 3-star (which will be used to update ), 4-star, 5-star, and 6-star images for Kai, processing each one according to the established archive and update workflow. This process will then be repeated for the remaining 15 heroes.
     - What will be achieved with this? All 22 hero portraits in the application will be visually updated to match the user's new art direction.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS (6 of 22 heroes complete, 1 in progress)
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A
     - Blocked on something: User to provide the next set of images for Kai the Tempest.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0: Complete Hero Portrait Updates**: Continue the process for the remaining 15 heroes after Kai the Tempest is done.
*   **Future Tasks (Currently PAUSED):**
    *   **Phase 6: Expo ↔ Unity Transport Integration**: Implement the real, on-device communication bridge between the Expo frontend and the Unity runtime. Scaffolding and security review were completed, but the task was paused.
    *   **P1: Re-enable RevenueCat Integration**: Follow the guide in .
    *   **P2: Backend Code Cleanup**: Refactor  to remove legacy, duplicated endpoints.
    *   **P2: Refine Selene Monetization Simulation**: The file  contains unaddressed logic.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Hero Archetype Definition**: Established a Design Authority Document and a detailed archetype list for all 22 heroes based on user input, defining their emotional, visual, and power layers.
- **Asset Archiving System**: Created a directory structure at  and a  system to archive all 6 ascension images for each hero while only using one in the app.
- **Hero Portrait Updates (6 of 22 complete)**:
  - **Azrael the Fallen**:  updated to 3-star portrait.
  - **Marcus the Shield**:  updated to 3-star portrait.
  - **Kane the Berserker**:  updated to 3-star portrait.
  - **Soren the Flame**:  updated to 3-star portrait.
  - **Lysander the Frost**:  updated to 3-star portrait.
  - **Theron the Storm**:  updated to 3-star portrait.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Refactor **: The task to remove legacy, duplicate endpoints from  remains outstanding. This is a source of technical debt and potential future bugs.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Backend code in  contains legacy, duplicated endpoints.
  - **Recurrence count**: 2+
  - **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Design-First Workflow**: The current work is entirely driven by user-provided design specifications and assets, with a strict no code change rule.
- **Asset Archiving**: A manual process of storing provided assets in a structured way for potential future use, without integrating them into the app's current logic. The  file in each folder acts as a local database for these assets.
- **Configuration-as-Code**: The hero list hardcoded in  is being treated as a configuration file. The agent is modifying this configuration, not the application's executable code.

**key DB schema**
  - No DB schema changes. Hero data is hardcoded in .

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
*   **Modified in this task**:
    *   : The  for 6 heroes has been updated.
*   **Created in this task**:
    *   : Entire directory and its contents for 7 heroes (Azrael, Marcus, Kane, Soren, Lysander, Theron, Kai). Each subdirectory contains image files and a .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **DESIGN PHASE IS ACTIVE**: Your current and only task is to continue the hero portrait replacement. Do NOT attempt to work on any other paused tasks (like the Unity bridge or RevenueCat).
- **THE 3-STAR RULE IS LAW**: For every hero, the user will provide 6 images. You must archive all 6, but only the **3-star image URL** should be used to update the  field in .
- **NO CODE OR SCHEMA CHANGES**: Do not add new fields to the  model (like ). Do not change any UI to handle different star portraits. This is a simple content replacement task.
- **Follow the established workflow**: For each new hero, create the  directory, add images and update the manifest as they are received, and update  only when the 3-star image arrives.

**documents created in this job**
  -  files for each hero being processed.
