```

### Identified Friction Points

| Point | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Stamina Wall** | Medium | 6-15 stamina per stage; natural regen 1/5min = 12/hr = 288/day |
| **Power Spikes** | High | Mini-bosses (every 5 stages) and chapter bosses have 1.5-2.5x power jumps |
| **No Skip Animation** | Low | Battles auto-complete but no visual skip option visible |
| **Dialog Interrupts** | Medium | Story dialogue requires tap-through; no "skip all" option documented |

### Missing Dopamine Beats

| Beat | Current State | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Victory Fanfare** | Needs video note | Check if victory screen has satisfying animation/sound |
| **Star Collection** | Basic UI | Could add star animation flying to counter |
| **Reward Reveal** | Single screen | Consider sequential reveal with anticipation |
| **Boss Intro** | Dialogue box | Could add boss entrance cinematic |
| **Chapter Complete** | Needs video note | Check if there's a celebration moment |

### PvP Pain Points

| Point | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Instant Resolution** | High | No battle animation = no tension, no counterplay feeling |
| **Mock Opponents** | Medium | System generates NPCs when player pool is thin |
| **No Draft/Normalization** | Medium | Power-based matchmaking but no stat normalization |
| **Ticket Pressure** | Low | 5 tickets, 30min regen = generous, no dark pattern |

---

## 4. FEEDBACK & CLARITY SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score (0-5) | Evidence | Video Note Needed? |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| **Readability** | 3 | UI shows power numbers; battle outcome unclear | YES — Check battle log visibility |
| **Agency** | 2 | Auto-battle dominant; no tactical decisions mid-fight | YES — Check manual vs auto impact |
| **Payoff** | 3 | Rewards display exists; victory celebration unclear | YES — Check win animations |
| **Failure Messaging** | 2 | "Defeat" shown; no tips on why or how to improve | YES — Check loss screen |
| **Reward Cadence** | 4 | First clear + sweep + daily dungeons = regular drops | NO — Code confirms cadence |
| **Progress Visibility** | 4 | Chapter progress bars, pity counters, star counts | NO — Code confirms |
| **Return Triggers** | 3 | Stamina regen, daily dungeons; unclear daily login bonus | YES — Check daily rewards flow |

**Overall Score: 21/35 (60%)** — Needs improvement in agency and failure feedback.

## 5. ECONOMY/PROGRESS TOUCHPOINTS

### Currency Entry Points

| Currency | Entry Points | Rate |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **Gold** | Campaign, Dungeons, Arena, Idle | High — Core progression |
| **Gems/Crystals** | Campaign boss, Milestones, Shop | Medium — Gacha pull fuel |
| **Soul Dust** | EXP Dungeon | Medium — Hero leveling |
| **Skill Essence** | Skill Dungeon | Medium — Skill upgrades |
| **Enhancement Stones** | Enhancement Dungeon | Medium — Gear power |
| **Arena Coins** | Arena battles | Low — Arena shop only |

### Currency Exit Points

| Currency | Exit Points | Rate |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Gold** | Hero level, Skill level, Gear enhance | Very High |
| **Gems** | Gacha summons, Stamina refresh | Medium |
| **Soul Dust** | Hero EXP | Medium |
| **All Shards** | Hero promotion | Medium |

### Bottleneck Analysis

| Bottleneck | Severity | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Gold Sink** | High | Hero leveling + gear enhancement both consume gold heavily |
| **Stamina** | Medium | PvE gated; idle system provides partial bypass |
| **Hero Shards** | High | Promotion requires specific shards; gacha RNG |
| **Equipment Drops** | Medium | Equipment dungeon has low drop rates |

### "Dead-End" Feelings

- **Chapter Power Wall**: Chapter 6+ requires ~45,000 power; natural F2P progression ~3 months
- **Hero Promotion Shard Drought**: Specific hero shards hard to target outside gacha
- **Equipment Set Completion**: Random drops make set bonuses luck-dependent

## 7. TOP 10 FIXES (Ranked)

### #1: Add Battle Visualization (PvE/PvP)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Battles resolve instantly with no visual feedback |
| **Why it matters** | Players can't feel the impact of their hero builds or decisions |
| **Proposed change** | Add 5-10 second animated battle sequence with damage numbers, skill activations, and HP bars |
| **Effort** | L (Large) — Requires animation system, art assets |
| **Impact** | 10 — Core engagement driver |
| **Risk** | Medium — Animation performance on low-end devices |
| **Telemetry** | `battle_watched_vs_skipped`, `battle_duration_viewed`, `engagement_after_animation` |

### #2: Victory/Defeat Celebration Screens

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Win/loss feels flat; no emotional spike |
| **Why it matters** | Dopamine delivery is the core loop reinforcement |
| **Proposed change** | Victory: confetti, sound, character pose, star animation. Defeat: tips, retry button, close-call indicator |
| **Effort** | M (Medium) — UI + animation + audio |
| **Impact** | 8 — High emotional value, moderate effort |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `victory_screen_duration`, `retry_after_defeat_rate`, `defeat_tip_interaction` |

### #3: Add Skip Dialogue Option

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Story dialogue interrupts flow; veterans want to skip |
| **Why it matters** | Repeat players and sweepers get frustrated |
| **Proposed change** | "Skip All" button in dialogue; auto-skip toggle in settings |
| **Effort** | S (Small) — UI + flag |
| **Impact** | 6 — Quality of life |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `dialogue_skipped_rate`, `skip_all_usage`, `story_completion_with_skip` |

### #4: Loss Feedback System

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Defeat screen shows "DEFEAT" with no guidance |
| **Why it matters** | Players don't know how to improve; churn risk |
| **Proposed change** | Show: power gap %, recommended hero type, suggested upgrades, "almost won" indicator if close |
| **Effort** | M — Logic + UI |
| **Impact** | 7 — Retention driver |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `defeat_reason_viewed`, `suggested_upgrade_followed`, `retry_after_tip` |

### #5: Boss Intro Cinematics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Chapter bosses feel like regular stages |
| **Why it matters** | Boss fights are progression milestones; should feel special |
| **Proposed change** | 3-5 second boss intro: name reveal, mechanic hint, dramatic pose |
| **Effort** | M — Art + animation |
| **Impact** | 6 — Emotional milestone |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `boss_intro_watched`, `boss_intro_skipped`, `engagement_post_boss_intro` |

### #6: PvP Battle Replay/Summary

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Arena battles are instant; no understanding of why you won/lost |
| **Why it matters** | Players can't learn from matches; feels like dice roll |
| **Proposed change** | Post-battle summary: "Your [Hero] dealt X damage", "Enemy [Hero] was countered", key moments |
| **Effort** | M — Battle log system + UI |
| **Impact** | 7 — PvP engagement |
| **Risk** | Medium — Need to balance information vs simplicity |
| **Telemetry** | `battle_summary_expanded`, `battle_summary_time_spent`, `pvp_engagement_after_summary` |

### #7: Reward Reveal Sequence

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Rewards appear all at once; no anticipation |
| **Why it matters** | Reward reveal is a dopamine opportunity being wasted |
| **Proposed change** | Sequential reveal: gold → materials → equipment → gems (if any), with sound/animation |
| **Effort** | S — Animation sequence |
| **Impact** | 5 — Polish |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `reward_reveal_watched_full`, `reward_reveal_tapped_through`, `reward_reveal_duration` |

### #8: Campaign Star Collection Animation

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Stars awarded but visually static |
| **Why it matters** | Stars are key progress metric; should feel earned |
| **Proposed change** | Animated stars flying to total counter; sound per star; sparkle effect |
| **Effort** | S — Animation |
| **Impact** | 4 — Polish |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `star_animation_completed`, `chapter_progress_viewed_after_star` |

### #9: Daily Login Reward Flow

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Unclear if daily login rewards exist; not visible in code review |
| **Why it matters** | Daily return triggers are retention fundamentals |
| **Proposed change** | Dedicated daily reward screen on login; 7-day streak bonuses; monthly calendar |
| **Effort** | M — Backend + UI |
| **Impact** | 8 — Core retention |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Telemetry** | `daily_login_claimed`, `login_streak_length`, `streak_broken_recovery` |

### #10: Arena Stat Normalization Option

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Problem** | Arena uses raw power; whales vs F2P imbalance potential |
| **Why it matters** | Ethical PvP requires skill > wallet |
| **Proposed change** | Add "Ranked" mode with stat normalization; "Open" mode keeps current system |
| **Effort** | L — Backend normalization logic + separate queue |
| **Impact** | 7 — Ethical + long-term health |
| **Risk** | Medium — Might reduce whale motivation |
| **Telemetry** | `ranked_vs_open_preference`, `normalized_win_rate_vs_power`, `pvp_spend_correlation` |
